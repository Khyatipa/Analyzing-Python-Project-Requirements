# Analyzing-Python-Project-Requirements
We investigated the complexities surrounding Python project requirements, particularly in the context of replicating projects sourced from GitHub repositories.
The primary concern lies in the inconsistency and potential inaccuracy of dependencies listed in requirements.txt, exacerbated by outdated files as projects evolve. To address these challenges, third-party tools
like pipreqs and pipfreeze have emerged as potential solutions to automate the generation of requirements.txt files. 
Through a comprehensive evaluation of pipreqs and pipfreeze, we found how pipreqs perform compared to pipfreeze, capturing required project dependencies. 
Even though pipreqs appears to be more promising, it is far from flawless.
